@article{kahntopo,
	abstract = {Topological Sorting is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of networks. An example of one such problem is PERT. The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order. It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency. Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090. A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time.  The method was developed as a byproduct of procedure needed by Westinghouse, Baltimore. It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it. In regard to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the Lockheed program, which is in current use.},

	abstract = {In discrete-ordinates (SN) simulations of large problems involving linear 
	interactions between radiation and matter, the underlying linear Boltzmann problem is 
	discretized and the resulting system of algebraic equations is solved iteratively. If the 
	physical system contains subregions that are optically thick with small absorption, the 
	simplest iterative process, Source Iteration, is inefficient and costly. During the past 40 years, 
	significant progress has been achieved in the development of acceleration methods that 
	speed up the iterative convergence of these problems. This progress consists of (i) a theory 
	to derive the acceleration strategies, (ii) a theory to predict the convergence properties of 
	the new strategies, and (iii) the implementation of these concepts in production computer 
	codes. In this Review we discuss the theoretical foundations of this work, the important 
	results that have been accomplished, and remaining open questions.},

@article{SOUCASSE2017215,
	abstract = {This paper investigates for the first time a goal-based angular adaptivity method for thermal radiation transport, suitable for non grey media when the radiation field is coupled with an unsteady flow field through an energy balance. Anisotropic angular adaptivity is achieved by using a Haar wavelet finite element expansion that forms a hierarchical angular basis with compact support and does not require any angular interpolation in space. The novelty of this work lies in (1) the definition of a target functional to compute the goal-based error measure equal to the radiative source term of the energy balance, which is the quantity of interest in the context of coupled flow-radiation calculations; (2) the use of different optimal angular resolutions for each absorption coefficient class, built from a global model of the radiative properties of the medium. The accuracy and efficiency of the goal-based angular adaptivity method is assessed in a coupled flow-radiation problem relevant for air pollution modelling in street canyons. Compared to a uniform Haar wavelet expansion, the adapted resolution uses 5 times fewer angular basis functions and is 6.5 times quicker, given the same accuracy in the radiative source term.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an angular adaptivity algorithm for Boltzmann transport applications which for the first time shows evidence of O(n) scaling in both runtime and memory usage, where n is the number of adapted angles. This adaptivity uses Haar wavelets, which perform structured h-adaptivity built on top of a hierarchical P0 FEM discretisation of a 2D angular domain, allowing different anisotropic angular resolution to be applied across space/energy. These wavelets can be mapped back to their underlying P0 space scalably, allowing traditional DG-sweep algorithms if desired. Instead we build a spatial discretisation on unstructured grids designed to use less memory than competing alternatives in general applications and construct a compatible matrix-free multigrid method which can handle our adapted angular discretisation. Fixed angular refinement, along with regular and goal-based error metrics are shown in three example problems taken from neutronics/radiative transfer applications.},

Cross sections for the different interaction mechanisms are approximated by expressions that permit the generation of random tracks by using purely analytical methods. Hard elastic collisions, with scattering angle greater than a preselected cutoff value, and hard inelastic collisions and radiative events, with energy loss larger than given cutoff values, are simulated in detail. Soft interactions, with scattering angle or energy loss less than the corresponding cutoffs, are simulated by means of multiple scattering approaches. This algorithm handles lateral displacements correctly and completely avoids difficulties related with interface crossing. The simulation is shown to be stable under variations of the adopted cutoffs; these can be made quite large, thus speeding up the simulation considerably, without altering the results. The reliability of the algorithm is demonstrated through a comparison of simulation results with experimental data. Good agreement is found for electrons and positrons with kinetic energies down to a few keV.},
